This includes:</p> <ul><li>working with workflow and time optimization throughout the design process,</li> <li>creating “managing and reporting” tools and methods,</li> <li>creating custom tools and addons,</li> <li>scripting,</li> <li>dynamo optimization,</li></ul> <p>I’m also creating personal tools to boost architectural workflow, as well as general BIM development. I could split this into four parts:</p> <ul><li>Revit addin - soon more about the tools on my blog <br/><a href="../images/code/revit-addin.jpg"><img src="../images/code/revit-addin.jpg" alt="revit-addin" title="WIP tools I&#39;m working on"/></a></li> <li>Blender analysis addons,</li> <li>GIS data importers, both for revit and blender: ex. functionality of importing terrain data from goverment webistes straight to revit.</li> <li>Independent project, lets call it <strong>Dash Dash Dot</strong>, more info soon.</li></ul> <p>And of course some old <a href="https://github.com/tibicen/cad" rel="nofollow">snippets for CAD workflow</a>.</p> <h2>Computer Graphics</h2> <ul><li>Blender Shadow Analysis - Analyze shadow impact on buildings, elements, urban plan with lat, long. Per hour, or period with step. (hourly, daily, monthly, yearly analysis).</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell" rel="nofollow">IFC importer for blender 2.80</a> - redo and big extension for Blender 2.80. [deprecated due to new BlenderBIM development]</li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/tibicen/simple-asset-manager" rel="nofollow">Simple Asset Manager for Blender 2.80</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tibicen/meshroom2blender" rel="nofollow">Blenders Meshroom importer</a></li> <li>Web VR: Blender exports VR spaces straight into HTML</li></ul> <h2>Others</h2> <ul><li>Dog Alone - When you leave your dog at home, and he’s howling, the app triggers and plays recorded sound of your calming voice once in a while. Webapp, but works locally.</li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/tibicen/inkscape-master-page-export" rel="nofollow">Inkscape Master Page Export</a> - Export separate layers with Master Page layer always visible. Semi functionality of “master page” in InDesign.</li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/tibicen/finance-stats" rel="nofollow">Finance Statistics and charts (offline)</a></li> <li>PKU: Android diet app - who knows the shortcut then knows what it does. For people with genetic issues that need really strict diet info.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tibicen/random-scripts" rel="nofollow">Random scripts, like space arrangement/collision based on weights between rooms</a></li></ul> <h2>Closed projects</h2> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tibicen/messengerStats" rel="nofollow">Messenger Chat statistics, word count</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tibicen/call-stats" rel="nofollow">Phonecall statistics from detailed bill</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tibicen/blender-scripts/blob/master/materialPass.py" rel="nofollow">Material Pass for Blender 2.79</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tibicen/ScrabbleSolver" rel="nofollow">Scrabble solver for Android</a></li></ul> <h2>The Web</h2> <p>As the life goes I’ve started to realize that some small elements in Wordpress didn’t fit my idea. I’ve started to dig. That was the moment I’ve learned <strong>CSS</strong>, and I knew it was good. At that moment I’ve realized how much rubbish I was writing in CSS. I knew little, it was fun, I got bored.</p> <p>Knowing <strong>Python</strong> I’ve got into <strong>Flask</strong>. And I knew it was good. Then came <code>pipenv</code>, errors. It was amazing! My own static website from base. It was time to make it more alive with <strong>js</strong>. And I knew it was good. With all the changes of 2018, it was time to leave <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, behindm and start to animate a little, and clean all unnecesarry div’s and classes. I’ve learned new words like <strong>“optimization”</strong> with PageSpeed and Lighthouse.</p> <h2>Active websites</h2> <ul><li><a href="http://www.tendra.is/" rel="nofollow">tendra.is</a></li> <li><a href="http://rodo.huczynski.pl/" rel="nofollow">rodo.huczynski.pl</a></li> <li><a href="https://r2.pl/" rel="nofollow">r2.pl</a></li> <li><a href="http://wojciech.huczynski.pl/" rel="nofollow">wojciech.huczynski.pl</a></li> <li><a href="http://dawid.huczynski.pl/" rel="nofollow">dawid.huczynski.pl</a></li></ul>',l;return t=new z({props:{title:"Code"}}),{c(){g(t.$$.fragment),i=f(),o=w("section"),o.innerHTML=s,this.h()},l(e){u(t.$$.fragment,e),i=b(e),o=y(e,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),v(o)!=="svelte-5c47xi"&&(o.innerHTML=s),this.h()},h(){I(o,"class","one-column")},m(e,a){k(t,e,a),n(e,i,a),n(e,o,a),l=!0},p,i(e){l||(_(t.$$.fragment,e),l=!0)},o(e){S(t.$$.fragment,e),l=!1},d(e){e&&(r(i),r(o)),A(t,e)}}}class P extends d{constructor(t){super(),m(this,t,null,x,c,{})}}export{P as component};
